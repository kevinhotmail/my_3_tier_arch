# A terraform. tfvars file is used to set the actual values of the variables. 
# You could set default values for all your variables and not use tfvars files at all.

# What is the difference between Tfvars and variables TF?
# These two files are similar but are not same. Syntactically speaking, a variables.tf file is used to define the variables type and optionally set a default value.

# If you changed the Region, then you need to retrospectively change the AMI ID to reflect that change. This needs to be changed in the code above.
# Now we have all the files needed to create our infrastructure and application. All we need to do is run it!
# Once you have configured your AWS credentials then follow these steps.

# In your terminal run these commands in orderâ€¦
# terraform init to initialise the working directory and download the plugins of the provider
# terraform plan is to create the execution plan for our code
# terraform apply is to create the actual infrastructure.
